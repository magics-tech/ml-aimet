AIMET TensorFlow Quantization SIM API

User Guide Link
===============
To learn more about Quantization Simulation, please see :ref:`Quantization Sim<ug-quantsim>`


Top-level API
=============

.. autoclass:: aimet_tensorflow.quantsim.QuantizationSimModel

|

**Note about Quantization Schemes** : AIMET offers multiple Quantization Schemes-
    1. Post Training Quantization- The encodings of the model are computed using TF or TF-Enhanced scheme
    2. Trainable Quantization- The min max of encodings are learnt during training.
        * Range Learning with TF initialization - Uses TF scheme to initialize the encodings and then during training these encodings are fine-tuned to improve accuracy of the model
        * Range Learning with TF-Enhanced initialization - Uses TF-Enhanced scheme to initialize the encodings and then during training these encodings are fine-tuned to improve accuracy of the model

**The following API can be used to Compute Encodings for Model**

.. automethod:: aimet_tensorflow.quantsim.QuantizationSimModel.compute_encodings


|

**The following API can be used to Export the Model to target**

.. automethod:: aimet_tensorflow.quantsim.QuantizationSimModel.export
   
|

Encoding format is described in the :ref:`Quantization Encoding Specification<api-quantization-encoding-spec>`
