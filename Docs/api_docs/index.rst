Welcome to AI Model Efficiency Toolkit API Docs!
================================================

AI Model Efficiency Toolkit (AIMET) is a software toolkit that enables users to compress
and quantize ML models. The resulting models returned by AIMET can be further trained (or fine-tuned)
to dramatically improve accuracy lost due to quantization and compression.

.. ifconfig:: 'keras' in  included_features

    AIMET is designed to work generically on any user-provided model. At present, AIMET supports
    TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch training frameworks.

    Please follow the links below to see AIMET APIs for either PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Keras.

    .. note:: AIMET Keras API requires Tensorflow 2.4 or later.

.. ifconfig:: 'keras' not in included_features

    AIMET is designed to work generically on any user-provided model. At present, AIMET supports
    TensorFlow and PyTorch training frameworks.

    Please follow the links below to see AIMET APIs for either PyTorch or TensorFlow.
